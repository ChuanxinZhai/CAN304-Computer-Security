### Here is the guidance of the codes.
These codes are about MD5 encryption.

##### main.py:
run this file

When "msg>>>" showed, input the **original message** (plaintext).

The program will produce its MD5

##### encrypt.py:

run this file

When "msg>>>" showed, input the **original message** (plaintext)

When "key>>>" showed, input the **key** (if input key not applicable, the program will ask for the key again)

_The key should be a number_

The program will produce its ciphertext.

##### verify.py:
run this file

When "msg>>>" showed, input the **original message** (plaintext)

When "key>>>" showed, input the key

When "cipher>>>" showed, input the ciphertext

The program will show the verification result (**True or False**)
